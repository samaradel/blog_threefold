## Our Magical Zero-Node

The guiding design principle at ThreeFold when developing technology is that simpler solutions increase efficiency and productivity. 

### Less = More

The Zero-OS (Stateless Operating System) node technology is based on technology that has been developed and innovated for 15 years in an incubation center. Mid to late 90’s, some of ThreeFold technological experts were working for a large American firm that was investing in creating Europe’s first large scale (internet) data centers as well as internet connectivity.  In that period 5 major datacenters were built and put into production. It became frustrating to see the amount of money, time and energy required to architect, install, operate and maintain these complex IT infrastructures. 

When ThreeFold was creates, it was very passionate times as they could finally work on better technology was created to address these issues.

To build a technology stack from point solutions with A-brand vendors requires a tremendous amount of software integrations,equipment and knowledge/ human resource effort.  The result is a very complicated operational setup that is costly, needs a lot of power and requires a large amount of maintenance contracts and engineers.

This inspired us to create more effective IT architectures powering workloads without the complexity and unnecessary components by starting an incubation center to specifically develop technologies creating more efficient ways of doing standard things such as:  


* **Using more of the available computing power** by virtualisation technologies allowing multiple tenants to use one physical machine.
* **Create a performing and reliable storage solution** by using standard off-the-shelf components and staying as far away as possible from proprietary hardware and software to enhance storage performance.
* **Create a low-level power management device** that is able to manage and monitor the whole upstream power feed and to create efficient power consumption.  One of the key aspects of this technology is that it measures Voltage and Amperage 25k times a second, which provides very detailed information about how the power supply is “consuming” energy  and allows for analytical failure prediction.

A Zero-Node consists of hardware and software. A Zero Node can be purchased from the ThreeFold Foundation Ecosystem or by downloading and installing the software on existing re-purposed hardware.
