The ThreeFold Grid’s capacity is made available by farmers — entrepreneurs who provide capacity by connecting hardware to the ThreeFold Grid. They build a more sustainable Internet for generations to come. The ThreeFold Network is changing the Internet for the highest good of all, and you can play a big role in this by becoming a farmer.

Here’s how things play out on the ThreeFold Network:

It all starts with the ThreeFold Farmer.

1. Farmers rent capacity to the ThreeFold Grid and get TFTs in return.
2. Farmers exchange their TFTs for other crypto or fiat currencies. Users exchange their fiat or crypto currencies for TFTs.
3. Users reserve capacity with TFTs, they pay farmers and part goes to the foundation.
