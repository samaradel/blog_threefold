## Creating solutions that respect humanity and the planet

### Respect Human Rights

- **Sustainability**: It is important for a very simple reason: we cannot maintain our quality of life as human beings, the diversity of life on our planet, or Earth's ecosystems unless we embrace and protect it's balance.
- **Equality**: Everyone should have a right to learn, dream, partake and succeed. Equal access also means affordable, not owned by big greedy companies.
- **Decentralisation**: To better distribute power, value and opportunities - we need more decentralization. Technologies and solutions should be available everywhere to improve equality and sustainability. 
- **Openness & Interoperability**: allows technologies to work together in an open way, without limitation, and therefore expands the possibilities for innovation and sharing.
- **Accessibility**: Whatever the location or situation, people should benefit from easy and fast access information and solutions.
- **Security & Privacy**: Protect people from being put in situations of danger or exploitation. People should be empowered to be independent and they should be the sole owners of their experiences.

###  Respect Human Effort

- **Reliability**: To make sure technologies are reliable and last longer.
- **Simplicity**: We need to keep things simple: no unnecessary complexity - less is more.
- **Transparency**: Let people and companies work together in a 100% transparent way.
- **Collaboration**: It's all about the greater picture. We are stronger together and have to help each other in reaching our common visions.

### Respect Human Experience

- **Ergonomy**: Products and solutions should empower productivity, safety and comfort, while reducing human error.
- **Inclusiveness**: Design should always be global and inclusive. We are all equal.
- **Design**: Products should be visually appealing and should achieve it's purpose.
- **Transparency**: Organisational records and strategies should be accessible to everyone.

Organizations should always respect human rights, human effort and human experience. To enable a sustainable and prosperous civilization and world we need a strong value system.
