# Decentralizing the Internet

##### In this article, we discuss the general concept of a ‘decentralized grid’ and how anyone is able to plug-in capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.

### Decentralization

In 1989, the Internet changed the world as we know it with the introduction of the World Wide Web. With time the Internet empowered people to share information in a decentralized way. Quickly, big companies like Facebook, Google and Apple emerged, providing many solutions that revolutionized the way we live. The “sharing economy” has been growing over the last 5-10 years. This is thanks to a more simplified information flow and well-developed technology, which: 

1. Enables a much easier integration of independent players into the sharing economy.
2. Eliminates the need for extensive management and structure of a marketplace operators.

We are entering a flat-structure economy. An economy where less managerial levels are needed for the system to function properly.

New technologies such as blockchain and the Internet of Things facilitate this ongoing trend. Participants can now interact on a peer-to-peer basis, forming marketplaces and organizations according to pre-agreed, programmed contracts.

### The current Internet is centralized

Despite the growth in popularity for decentralized systems, organizations, and currencies, the Internet remains centralized.

The centralization within the Internet industry brought many barriers of entry. Indeed, to compete in the highly competitive market of Internet capacity dominated by big IT companies, massive investment and IT development are needed.

But what's really scary is that the current industry exploits the market tremendously. Data is officially the most valuable asset on earth since a few years, and about 20 companies rule over more than 80% of the cloud industry. In other words - these companies together have more than 80% of the world's information. In recent years, we noticed the dangers that can arise with the wrong intentions within the data industry with the 'Cambridge Analytica Scandal', also highlighted in the movie ['The Great Hack'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX8GxLP1FHo).

Over the last several years, ThreeFold has been developing technology that allow the decentralization of the Internet infrastructure - removing the need for datacenters, and allowing anyone to take part in the Internet capacity market. Adding capacity to the ThreeFold Grid (TF Grid) makes you a ThreeFold Farmer (TF Farmer). The more decentralized the Internet gets, the more secure it will be. The ThreeFold Grid is an ultra-secure and private Internet Grid, and is already the largest grid of compute and storage in the world.

### How to become a ThreeFold Farmer

The process of becoming a ThreeFold Farmer is very straightforward. Anyone can join the ThreeFold Grid by downloading the ThreeFold Zero-OS onto their nodes and connecting them to the ThreeFold Grid. By doing so you will be an operator of a "micro datacenter" and earn ThreeFold Tokens. With or without experience in the field, anyone can become a ThreeFold Farmer. By becoming a ThreeFold Farmer, you empower a new neutral Internet which belongs to humanity - not corporations.

Internet Capacity produced by a node is registered on the ThreeFold Directory. The ThreeFold Directory is a public directory of global purchasers of Internet Capacity on the ThreeFold Grid. There is no need to build a marketing plan/department or to promote your available capacity.

Pricing is set by the ThreeFold Directory's algorithm based on numerous factors including real-time local supply and demand, competition, network connection, hardware type and the environment to ensure fair pricing for both the supplier and consumer. ThreeFold Farmers are also allowed to set their own pricing in specific scenarios.
